---

## Phase 4: Bridge Feature

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Integrate external bridge aggregator for cross-chain token transfers

**Status**: In Progress

### Architecture Decision

- **Approach**: Integrate LI.FI SDK (`@lifi/sdk`) with custom UI
- **Rationale**: Built natively on viem, full TypeScript support, compatible with wagmi v2, broad chain coverage, no backend infrastructure needed
- **Integrator fee**: 3% via LI.FI's built-in fee system (requires whitelisting)
- **Target chains (initial)**: BSC (56), Base (8453), Worldchain (480)
- **Future expansion**: KUB Chain, JB Chain, additional providers

### Research & Evaluation (COMPLETE)

- [x] Evaluate bridge aggregator providers (LI.FI, Socket/Bungee, Squid Router)
- [x] Verify chain support for BSC, Base, Worldchain
- [x] Compare SDK quality, TypeScript support, viem/wagmi compatibility
- [x] Review pricing models and license terms
- [x] Test quote API with target chain pairs

### Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

- [x] Install `@lifi/sdk` dependency
- [x] Create bridge types (`types/bridge.ts`)
- [x] Create LI.FI SDK client config (`lib/lifi.ts`)
- [x] Create bridge Zustand store (`store/bridge-store.ts`)
- [x] Create LI.FI service functions (`services/bridge/lifi.ts`)
- [x] Create bridge quote hook (`hooks/useBridgeQuote.ts`)
- [x] Create bridge execution hook (`hooks/useBridgeExecution.ts`)
- [x] Create chain selector component (`components/bridge/chain-select.tsx`)
- [x] Create bridge status tracker (`components/bridge/bridge-status.tsx`)
- [x] Create main bridge card UI (`components/bridge/bridge-card.tsx`)
- [x] Update bridge page (`app/bridge/page.tsx`)
- [x] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Contact LI.FI to whitelist integrator for fee collection
- [ ] Test on mainnet with real transactions
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness polish
